This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your SubLite Account) or by means of a notice on the Site. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (http://www.sublite.com/terms).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As used in this policy, the terms &quot;using&quot; and &quot;processing&quot; information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">International Transfer</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO - AND MAINTAINED ON - COMPUTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF YOUR STATE, PROVINCE, COUNTRY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTION WHERE THE PRIVACY LAWS MAY NOT BE AS PROTECTIVE AS THOSE IN YOUR JURISDICTION. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CHOOSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US, SUBLITE TRANSFERS PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROCESSES IT THERE. YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY FOLLOWED BY YOUR SUBMISSION OF SUCH INFORMATION REPRESENTS YOUR AGREEMENT TO THAT TRANSFER.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Information Collection and Use</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our primary goal in collecting information is to facilitate the search functionality of our Site in order to connect students listing and search for housing, as well as students with recruiters. The listing information you provide about your property will be used solely to allow guests to find accommodations that meet their needs. The listing information you provide about your company and job position will be used solely to allow students to search among job postings. We will not use such information for any other purposes such as tracking your location. We will not sell that information, or any other personally identifiable information, to third-parties. Potential advertisers or sponsors on our site will only be able to create targeted advertising based on non-identifiable demographic information such as your university, class year, and gender. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">Personally Identifiable Student Information</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you register with us and become a User and when you choose to post a Listing, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (&quot;Identity Information&quot;). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, university email address, class year, gender, and home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. Unless you choose to release your entire name, only your first name and last initial will be visible to other Users. They will also see your class year. However, before they can view your contact email address, they must confirm that they intend to contact you only in good-faith about your Listing. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No other information will be required upon registration. Optional information includes your cell phone number, Facebook and LinkedIn profile link, gender, and date of birth. It is in your discretion whether this additional info will enhance your Listing or profile when contacting hosts. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0 c1">Use of Data by Recruiters</span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0">Recruiters using the Site have access to and must use student data only for recruiting, interviewing, and hiring purposes. Employers to whom student data is released must use such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service, and their own internal privacy policies. Students that have questions regarding the privacy practices and policies of employers with respect to personal information should contact the employer directly.</span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0 c1">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0"><i>Housing</i></span> <p class="c2"><span class="c0">When creating a housing Listing, we will require relevant information to enhance the search functionality of our Site. This Identify Information includes your housing type, amenities, and physical address. The exact address of your building will not be disclosed to other Users. The address will only be used so other users can determine the proximity of your Accommodation to their work location based on the Accommodation&rsquo;s general area and neighborhood. They will only be able to view the distance from your building to their workplace. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We reserve the right to require address confirmation for Accommodations included in Listings. If we require such confirmation, we will send a code via postal mail to the address contained in a Listing and ask you to enter the code via the Site in order to confirm the address of the Accommodation included in the applicable Listing. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We may also use your university email address to contact you with SubLite newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You will have the option to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; in the newsletter. Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt-out of these notifications.</span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0"><i>Company Profiles and Job Postings</i></span><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As a recruiter, you will be asked to create a company profile and associated job listings on behalf of your employer. In order to enhance your profile, you are encouraged to respond to the questionnaire asking about the unique attributes of your company and its culture. Job postings require information such as compensation and start-dates, that students can use to filter among competing postings. Do not list any confidential information or trade secrets in the company profiles and job postings.</span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0 c1">Internal Messaging System</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the convenience of its Student and Recruiter Users, SubLite provides an internal messaging system. Students may contact each other to inquire about housing listings, and contact Recruiters with questions about the job listing. SubLite monitors the header information in these communications. This includes the time of the message, sender, and recipient. All header information and content of the messages is stored on SubLiteâ€™s servers. We receive an email copy of each communication to our SubLite account.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The header information will be used to analyze the success of certain listings in generating interest in order to improve the user experience. We do not reveal the header information or message content to other recruiters, other Users, universities, or any other third-parties. We do not sell this information to third-parties. We used it internally to generate analytics.</span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0">After the initial communication, all users are encouraged to continue the inquiry or negotiations through phone or personal email. All communications must be made in good-faith to inquire about housing or job opportunities. </span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0 c1">Student Universities</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Your university will not have access to any subsequent registration or listing information you provide. We will only disclose such personal information if we deem it necessary in order to report users who have violated our Terms of Service by, for example, misleading, threatening, defrauding, spamming, or invading the privacy of other Users. We also reserve the right to disclose your information to report conduct to the appropriate authorities, if necessary, and to comply with legal proceedings. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">WE WILL NOT USE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO TRACK YOU OR TO SELL TO THIRD-PARTIES. IT WILL ONLY BE USED TO FACILITATE THE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SITE. HOWEVER, IF YOU VIOLATE SUBLITEâ€™S TERMS OF SERVICE, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION WHEN CONTACTING YOUR UNIVERSITY OR THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY. </span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0 c1">Log Data</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When you visit the Site, whether as a User or a non-registered user, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (&quot;Log Data&quot;).

We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we or third-parties may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Non-Identifying Information and Log Data information for the same purposes as stated above. </span></p><p class="c2"> <span class="c0 c1">Cookies</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Like many websites, we use &quot;cookies&quot; to collect information.
