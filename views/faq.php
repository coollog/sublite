      <subheadline>Who can create an internship listing?</subheadline>

      Only verified HR personnel and recruiters can register for a company profile and post internships. Once they register for an account, we follow-up to make sure they are legitimate recruiters before activating their listing. 
      <br /><br />
      If you are a recruiter, contact <a href="mailto: info@sublite.net">info@sublite.net</a> to learn more!

      <subheadline>Who do I contact to find out more about an internship listing?</subheadline>

      SubLite provides the platform for recruiters to create a company profile and post internships. A recruiter’s profile next to the listing will contain all the contact information you need to reach out and learn more. 

      <subheadline>How do I apply for a job? </subheadline>

      On every listing there is a “Apply Now” button that will redirect you to the company’s application page. Your candidacy will only be considered if you submit an application through the firm’s official website. 

      <subheadline>Is there a limit on the number of internships I can apply to?</subheadline>

      Absolutely not! You may apply to as many internships as you wish. 

      <subheadline>Can I share an internship listing with a friend not registered on SubLite?</subheadline>

      While you need to be a verified student with a .edu email to search housing and internship listings, you can share each with the listing’s url. Anyone who has the url will see the information although they won’t be able to interact with other registered users.
