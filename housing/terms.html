You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware for any actions for which the parties&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">retain the right to seek&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights,&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dispute Resolution</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You and SubLite agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site (collectively, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Disputes</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&rsquo;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and SubLite are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and SubLite otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#39;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section will survive any termination of these Terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in effect, except as modified by this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section. (The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;</span><span class="c7"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adr.org%2Farb_med&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFm2AXnAFhN2ouHdiuj_0-hVNQo8A">http://www.adr.org/arb_med</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at&nbsp;</span><span class="c7"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adr.org%2Faaa%2FShowPDF%3Fdoc%3DADRSTG_004175&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEl5kadlqzeOUPHL-DvokoPGGsSjg">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and a separate form for California residents at</span><span class="c7"><a class="c4" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fadr.org%2Faaa%2FShowPDF%3Fdoc%3DADRSTG_004314&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEm2I2W8-NeMj2TQEw9MhjPMMUi8g">http://adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004314</a></span><span class="c1">.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Delaware and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&rsquo;s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and SubLite otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Delaware. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and SubLite submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Arbitrator&rsquo;s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the &ldquo;Limitation of Liability&rdquo; section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&rsquo;s individual claim. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the &ldquo;Modification&rdquo; section above, if SubLite changes this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to&nbsp;</span><span class="c7"><a class="c4" href="mailto:terms@airbnb.com">terms@SubLite.net</a></span><span class="c1">) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &ldquo;Last Updated Date&rdquo; above. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and SubLite in accordance with the provisions of this &ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo; section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">General</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The failure of SubLite to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of SubLite. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</span></p><p class="c11"><span></span></p></body></html>
