<b>About Us</b>
<br /><br />
We know you&rsquo;ve worked hard to network and get top grades for your dream summer job, but that&rsquo;s only half the journey. Now you need to find your perfect summer accommodations so you can sip cocktails on your rooftop under the moonlight after work. Founded by students at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, SubLite provides an easy solution to finding the perfect summer sublet for university students across the United States. SubLite is an exclusive student-to-student platform for listing and discovering sublets to complement summer internships. Unlike other housing platforms, all our users are verified using their school email addresses. Say goodbye to horror housing stories!
<br /><br />
<b>How It Works</b>
<br /><br />
We work with universities committed to assisting students with the summer internships to subscribe to the site on their students&rsquo; behalf. Only students with verified emails will be able to create profiles. Hosts create listings for the space they are offering to sublet. Our enhanced search functionality captures the essence of an ideal sublet for university students: proximity to workplace, public transportation options, price per week, and privacy. Once a sublet hunter has found an ideal space, he or she simply contacts the host by email and works out a deal – we trust you to decide on the terms and payment directly!

<b>The Team</b>
<br /><br />
<b>Alisa Melekhina</b><br />
<b>Affiliation:</b> University of Pennsylvania<br />
Alisa is a third-year law student at the University of Pennsylvania and is also completing a Certificate in Business Economics and Public Policy from Wharton Business School. She worked in the legal department of FOX Entertainment in Los Angeles this past summer and interned for a judge in DC her first year summer. After optimistically thinking that the internship search process was over, she was rudely awakened by a newfound realization: finding summer housing was a pain. For months it was the same old story: getting directed to the same sites by both the university’s career service and HR departments. She decided that it was time to make the summer housing search much easier. And so SubLite was born.

<b>Yuanling Yuan</b><br />
<b>Affiliation:</b> Yale University<br /> 
Yuanling is a sophomore at Yale University majoring in economics and has always been a passionate and dedicated entrepreneur. In 2009, she founded Chess in the Library, a non-profit organization that runs chess programs in over 40 public libraries across North America. After exchanging summer internship experiences with her friends in the fall, she was surprised to discover the sheer quantity of horror stories that pertained to summer housing. So when Alisa, a dedicated friend from international chess tournaments, conceptualized SubLite, Yuanling immediately jumped on the boat! She is excited to bring her entrepreneurial expertise to the team and revolutionize the summer subletting process for university students.
