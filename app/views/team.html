        <p class="membername">Alisa Melekhina</p>
        <p class="memberposition">Co-Founder, University of Pennsylvania Law School</p>
        <p class="memberbio">Alisa graduated with her Juris Doctor from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in May 2014 and also completed a Certificate in Business Economics and Public Policy at Wharton Business School. She is currently working at a corporate law firm in NYC in the fields of intellectual property and white-collar litigation.
        <br />
          Alisa worked as an intern in the legal department of FOX Entertainment in Los Angeles in the summer of 2013 and interned for a judge in DC over the summer of 2012. After optimistically thinking that the internship search process was over, she was rudely awakened by a newfound realization: finding summer housing was a pain. For months it was the same old story: getting directed to the same sites by both the universityâ€™s career service and HR departments. She decided that it was time to make the summer housing search much easier. And so SubLite was born.

        <p class="memberposition">Co-Founder, Yale University</p>
        <p class="memberbio">Yuanling is a junior at Yale University majoring in Economics and has always been a passionate and dedicated entrepreneur. In 2009, she founded Chess in the Library, a non-profit organization that runs chess programs in over 40 public libraries across North America. During the past two summers, she first-handedly experienced the difficulties of securing a rewarding summer internship followed by a verified and comfortable sublet. Along with Alisa, a dedicated friend from international chess tournaments, Yuanling co-founded SubLite in February 2014 to provide university students a one-stop shop for the complete summer experience. She is excited to bring her entrepreneurial expertise to the team and revolutionize the summer internship and housing search process for university students across the country.

        <p class="memberposition">CMO, Yale University</p>
        <p class="memberbio">Shirley is a senior at Yale University majoring in Psychology and Economics. Through her various experiences in telecommunications, Asian American activism and consulting, she has developed a passion for both marketing and strategy. A series of unrelated events &mdash; namely, a Master&rsquo;s Tea (speaker event) and a residential college mentorship program &mdash; led Shirley to Yuanling and Alisa. At the time, Shirley just so happened to be searching for summer housing (and was having a not-so-great-experience), so she was extremely intrigued by what SubLite had to offer. She joined the SubLite team and is pumped to be driving marketing initiatives for SubLite! In her spare time, Shirley enjoys listening to R&amp;B, playing squash, eating tomatoes, and reading science fiction.
