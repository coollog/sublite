      <subheadline>What’s new on Internships 2.0?</subheadline>

      Applying for internships and jobs has never been easier. You can now pre-write your answers standard application questions. Employers will choose from a pool of these questions in their applications, so applying can be done in a matter of seconds, not hours. Companies can view your profile, which has a general overview of what makes you unique, along with your qualifications and resume.

      <subheadline>How do I apply for a job?</subheadline>

      On every listing there is a “Apply Now” button that will redirect you to the company’s application page. Your candidacy will only be considered if you submit an application through SubLite’s internal application system.

      <subheadline>Is there a limit on the number of internships I can apply to?</subheadline>

      Absolutely not! You may apply to as many internships as you wish.

      <subheadline>Is there a word limit to my question responses?</subheadline>

      No, you can answer your questions fully, with no word requirements to hold you back. You can fill in responses as needed for applications, or fill them all out at once. It’s up to you!

      <subheadline>Do I need to fill out my profile?</subheadline>

      Your profile is how recruiters get their first impression of you. If it’s not fully filled out, then what kind of first impression does that make?

      <subheadline>Can I share an internship listing with a friend not registered on SubLite?</subheadline>

      While you need to be a verified student with a .edu email to search housing and internship listings, you can share each with the listing’s url. Anyone who has the url will see the information although they won’t be able to interact with other registered users.

        If my space is no longer available, how do I take it down?
        <br />
        Can I hide my listing so I can reuse it next year?
      </subheadline>

      Absolutely. We know that students may want to sublet the same space year after year. To make your life easier, we created a “publish-unpublish” function. You can unpublish your listing anytime by going to <a href="<?php vecho('dirpre'); ?>../housing/Manage.php">Manage</a>, clicking a listing to access its editing page, and unchecking the Publish? option. Next year when you’re ready to sublet again, simply check Publish? again to reactivate. You can also make edits to your listings anytime.

      <subheadline>What legal issues should I consider before hosting on SubLite?</subheadline>

      Make sure you have permission from your landlord or owner of your space to sublet. Before you list, you will have to agree that you can legally sublet according to our Terms of Use.

      Please also ensure all information in your listing is accurate and not misleading. For more guidance, refer to our Terms of Use.

      <subheadline>When should I contact a host?</subheadline>

      As soon as you find a space that interests you. Don’t wait until the last-minute, or it may be gone!
      <br />
      Legitimate reasons to contact another user are to ask questions about the amenities and to inquire about price. Please contact hosts in good-faith. Spamming is expressly prohibited. For more guidance, refer to our <a href="<?php vecho('dirpre'); ?>../terms.php">Terms of Use</a>.

      <subheadline>What will my listing and profile information be used for?</subheadline>

      We will use this solely to enhance the search functionality of SubLite to make it easier to connect hosts and guests. We require your property’s address so other users can estimate proximity to their workplace. Your exact address will not be disclosed.
      <br />
      We will not sell your information. You may see targeted advertising from sponsors based solely on non-identifying information such as your university and class year. We will not pass any of your information along to your universities, unless you violate the Terms of Use.
      <br />
      For more information, read our <a href="<?php vecho('dirpre'); ?>../privacy.php">Privacy Policy</a>.

      <subheadline>Where can I leave feedback?</subheadline>

      Whether you like our website or not, we want to hear what you have to say. If you have a funny or horrific summer housing experience, we also want to hear from you. Email us at <a href="mailto: info@sublite.net">info@sublite.net</a>.

      <subheadline>Who can create an internship listing?</subheadline>

      First, create a recruiter profile. After that, you may create a new listing. There you’ll be able to personalize your company’s profile, describe your listing, and choose which questions you’d like your applicants to answer. Click “post” and then you’re set!

      <subheadline>If I already have an internal application, can I link it?</subheadline>

      We know you may prefer to place a link to your company’s official website, but students may only apply through the SubLite website. Each listing profile is fully customizable; resume and student profile pages are automatically included in each application.

      <subheadline>Is there a limit to the number of questions I can include in the application?</subheadline>

      No, feel free to include any number of questions in your application!

      <subheadline>Is there a word limit to the answers of the questions?</subheadline>

      No, students are free to fully answer questions.
